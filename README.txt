Welcome to my (Avinash Bissoondial) TSP Program! Read through this document to learn how to run and install the needed libraries to run this program.

First, you must have python installed on your computer. 

The following libraries are used:
Pandas
Numpy
mpu
matplotlib
random

The easiest way to install these packages is to install pip and write the following in the terminal:

pip install 'library_name'

where 'library_name' is replaced with any of the packages mentioned above. 

Lastly, the uscities.csv file should be in the same folder as the python file. 

Actually runnning the program is easy: 
1. Hit run and input an integer for how many cities you want to have in your tour
2. The greedy algorithm will run and a graph will be generated. Close the graph to continue the program
3. Enter if you want to test the local search algorithm Y or N
4. If yes, enter how many times the algorithm should be looped (50-100 works well), and a new distance, city list, and graph will be generated.
